* Bug #17350: "pear install --force" doesn't uninstall files from previous pkg versions [dufuz]
* Bug #18362: A whitespace TEMP_DIR path breaks install/upgrade functionality [dufuz]
* Bug #18440: bad tmp folder path on install : Unable to create path for C:/Program/tmp [dufuz]
* Bug #18581: "config-get -c" not returning channel's configuration when using alias [dufuz]
* Bug #18639: regression: installing xdebug fails most likely due to another fix [dufuz]

Features
* All System (the class) functions can now take in spaced paths as long as they are surrounded in quotes.
  Prior to this it was possible to do that by passing all values in as an array (by product of #18362, #18440) [dufuz]";s:1:"f";s:6:"296332";s:1:"g";s:34:"http://pear.php.net/get/PEAR-1.9.4";s:1:"x";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:17:"package.1.9.4.xml";}}}
